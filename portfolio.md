This is a draft scaffold for the audio portfolio in English 506, "Readers Are Listening" (Fall 2020), a graduate seminar at the University of Victoria. 

## Description of the Seminar

“Readers are listening.” We'll treat that sentence, including its many implications, as a refrain for this seminar.

Readers are listening because, as a [2018 BookNet Canada report](https://www.booknetcanada.ca/readers-are-listening) suggests, more and more of them are purchasing audiobooks and subscribing to podcasts. Readers are listening because publishers, writers, actors, and critics are taking sound more seriously. Readers are listening because they’ve been diagnosed with print disabilities or visual impairments. They are listening because they are multitasking—listening while commuting, working at home, or engaging in hobbies. Readers are listening because they enjoy it, they need a break from screens, or they’re playing games. The list goes on, all to demonstrate that the combination of reading and listening, or the characterization of listening as reading, is not a contradiction. Listening is not “cheating,” or passive, or homogeneous, and it’s long been central to the interpretation of fiction. This seminar explores how and why by treating listening as a critical practice.

You’ll have the opportunity to test various approaches to listening by studying fiction (mostly Anglo-American) from the 20th and 21st centuries. To invite an array of expertise on the topic, I’ve selected a range of works that not only engage themes of sound and listening (as content) but also experiment with audio formats, such as radio plays, talking books, cut-ups, recorded readings, serialized drama, voice-over narration, and first-person videogames, where listeners cannot see the “source” of a sound. Each week, we’ll examine a work or two with a particular theme or technique in mind. Themes will include listening to writers read, listening to narrators speak, listening for meaning, listening for effects, listening with others, listening in place, listening against the grain, listening inside acoustic spheres, and listening with machines. Across them, we’ll consider the aesthetics and sensory politics of how readers listen to fiction and how fiction is composed to be heard. I’ll also encourage you to try writing for readers who are listening by asking you to develop a portfolio of audio work comprised of brief exercises that culminate in a podcast episode about a seminar topic of your choice. (You can use a mobile phone or computer to record, and free audio software to edit. If you do not have access to these technologies, then the portfolio and episode can be written without producing or editing audio.)

## Aims of the Portfolio

The portfolio is intended to help you not only experiment with audio as a way to engage fiction but also gradually develop an episode for a podcast of your design.  

To keep it social, the portfolio will be accompanied by weekly discussion forums about what we're studying in the seminar. Those forums are not mentioned below but should be assumed.  

Don't worry too much about post-production or audio quality here. Focus on the content and not the tech for now. This is not an audio engineering course. 

## Step 1 (Sept. 15th): Technology Survey 

Complete a technology survey to let me know your needs and preferences, including those related to working with audio this term.  

## Step 2 (Sept. 22nd): Pick a Podcast and Press Record

Pick a podcast (such as SpokenWeb, Sounding Out!, or Phantom Power) to follow for the next ten weeks and also practice recording stuff with Kaltura, Audacity, or whatever software works for you.  

This week, we'll read a collection of brief introductions to listening from a sound studies angle. Authors include Tara Rodgers, Jonathan Sterne, Dylan Robinson, Michel Chion, Pauline Oliveros, Michele Hilmes, Tom Rice, and Mara Mills.  

## Step 3 (Sept. 29th): Record Your First Take 

Engage an issue raised during the first three weeks of seminar by recording yourself talking about it. This is an opportunity for you to experiment with your voice(s) as a medium and to determine how (or to what degree) you want to rely on a script when recording. 

Specs for the audio file: 5-8 minutes of you talking, plus a one- or two-sentence description of the recording and a list of works mentioned in it  

This week, we'll listen to *The Bluest Eye*, by (and read by) Toni Morrison. I'll point you to related material that may be of interest. 

## Step 4 (Oct. 6th): Describe Your Podcast 

Draft a description (250 words) of a podcast you might produce based on material from this seminar, including your recording from last week. You might want to scan this entire document (Steps 1 - 13) to see if there's something scheduled that may especially appeal to your own research. Your podcast description should include a title, theme, interests, topic(s) you'll address, your intended audience, and, if you wish, a few words about your style or approach. You might also want to compare it with other podcasts, especially similar ones. 

This week, we'll continue listening to *The Bluest Eye* (1970), by (and read by) Toni Morrison. I'll point you to related material that may be of interest.   

## Step 5 (Oct. 13th): Record Some Dialogue 

Engage an issue raised during the first five weeks of seminar by recording dialogue (or banter) with someone else in the seminar. This should be an opportunity to integrate conversations and other perspectives into your proposed podcast. This recording will count "double": as your recording for the week and theirs. 

Specs for your audio file: 10-15 minutes of you talking with someone else, plus a one- or two-sentence description of the recording and a list of works mentioned in it 

This week, we'll listen to recordings of Edwidge Danticat reading (2013) Jamaica Kincaid’s "Girl" (1978) and "Wingless" (1979) and Joyce Carol Oates reading (2009) Eudora Welty’s “Where Is the Voice Coming From?” (1963). I'll point you to related material that may be of interest.   

## Step 6 (Oct. 20th): Revise and Edit  

Now that some time has passed, revise the description for your proposed podcast and edit your first two recordings where / if necessary. 

This week, we'll listen to recordings of Samuel Beckett's *All That Fall: A Play for Radio* (1956-7) and Lucille Fletcher's *Sorry, Wrong Number* (1943). I'll point you to related material that may be of interest.  

## Step 7 (Oct. 27th): Record an Analysis of Voice or Dialogue 

Engage an issue raised during the first seven weeks of seminar by recording your analysis of a recorded voice or dialogue of your choice from what we've studied. This is your opportunity to treat audio as an object of inquiry in your proposed podcast.

Specs for your audio file: 5-10 minutes of you analyzing audio, plus a one- or two-sentence description of the recording and a list of works mentioned in it  

This week, we'll listen to recordings of Brion Gysin and William S. Burroughs's "Recalling All Active Agents" (1960), Laurie Anderson's *O Superman* (1981), Alvin Lucier's *I Am Sitting in a Room* (1969-70), Steve Reich's *Come Out* (1966), Delia Derbyshire's "Ziwzih Ziwzih OO-OO-OO" (1967), dub by King Tubby (1960s and '70s), and DJ Kool Herc's breakbeats (1970s and '80s). I'll point you to related material that may be of interest.   

## Step 8 (Nov. 3rd): Let's Bib 

We'll start a collaboratively annotated bibliography that may inform your podcast episode. Please annotate two entries on the list and leave your name (in brackets) at the end of those entries. 

This week, we'll watch and listen to voice-over performances by Regina King (2005), Edward Norton (1999), Christina Ricci (1998), and Sissy Spacek (1973). I'll point you to related material that may be of interest.

## Step 9 (Nov. 10th): Take a Break 

Step away from the seminar and your podcast for a bit. 

## Step 10 (Nov. 17th): Record an Analysis of a Sound Object or Soundscape 

Engage an issue raised during the first ten weeks of seminar by recording your analysis of a sound object (such as an effect) or a soundscape of your choice from what we've studied. This is your opportunity to engage audio beyond semantic listening. 

Specs for your audio file: 5-10 minutes of you analyzing audio, plus a one- or two-sentence description of the recording and a list of works mentioned in it

This week, we'll listen to *Within the Wires* (Season One, "Relaxation Cassettes") (2016), by Jeffrey Cranor, Janina Matthewson, and Mary Epworth. I'll point you to related material that may be of interest.

## Step 11 (Nov. 24th): Revise, Edit, Abstract, and Annotate 

Review your audio work thus far, revise and edit it where / if necessary, and draft a description (250 words) of the first episode of your podcast. Also annotate two more entries in our collaborative bib and leave your name after your annotations. 

This week, we'll watch or play either Giant Sparrow's *What Remains of Edith Finch* (2017) or Lucas Pope's *Return of the Obra Dinn*  (2018). I'll point you to related material that may be of interest. 

## Step 12 (Dec. 1st): Record Part of Your First Episode 

Engage an issue raised during the seminar by recording part of your podcast's first episode. This is your opportunity to select critical approaches that work best for you and test them. You are also more than welcome to engage primary material beyond what we've studied; however, I recommend focusing on the role of audio and listening in one or two of the following formats: radio plays, talking books (or audiobooks), cut-ups, recorded readings, serialized drama (podcasts), voice-over narration, or first-person videogames.

Specs for your audio file: 3-8 minutes of you critically approaching audio and fiction how you wish, plus a 250-word description of your episode and a list of works mentioned in it 

## Step 13 (Dec. 15th): Record, Edit, and Polish Yout First Episode 

Engage an issue raised during the seminar by recording, editing, and polishing your podcast's first episode. This is your opportunity to synthesize what you've learned and put your own spin on it, with attention to primary materials of your choice.  

Specs for your audio file: 12-20 minutes of you critically approaching audio and fiction how you wish, plus a 250-word description of your episode, a transcript for it, and a list of all works mentioned in it; be sure to introduce yourself and your podcast and to include verbal acknowledgments at the end; intro music, sound effects, and ambient sounds are optional; avoid overdoing it, tho :)
