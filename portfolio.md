This is a draft scaffold for the audio portfolio in English 506, "Readers Are Listening" (Fall 2020), a graduate seminar at the University of Victoria. 

## The Aim

The portfolio is intended to help you not only experiment with audio as a way to engage fiction but also gradually develop an episode for a podcast of your design.  

To keep it social, the portfolio will be accompanied by weekly discussion forums about what we're studying in the seminar. Those forums are not mentioned below but should be assumed.  

Don't worry too much about post-production or audio quality here. Focus on the content and not the tech for now. This is not an audio engineering course. 

## Step 1 (Sept. 15th): Technology Survey 

Complete a technology survey to let me know your needs and preferences, including those related to working with audio this term.  

## Step 2 (Sept. 22nd): Pick a Podcast and Press Record

Pick a podcast to follow for the next ten weeks and also practice recording stuff with Kaltura, Audacity, or whatever software works for you.  

## Step 3 (Sept. 29th): Record Your First Take 

Engage an issue raised during the first three weeks of seminar by recording yourself talking about it. This is an opportunity for you to experiment with your voice(s) as a medium and to determine how (or to what degree) you want to rely on a script when recording. 

Specs for the audio file: 5-8 minutes of you talking, plus a one- or two-sentence description of the recording and a list of works mentioned in it  

## Step 4 (Oct. 6th): Describe Your Podcast 

Draft a description (250 words) of a podcast you might produce based on material from this seminar, including your recording from last week. Your description should include a title, theme, interests, topic(s) you'll address, and your intended audience. You might also want to compare it with other podcasts, especially similar ones. 

## Step 5 (Oct. 13th): Record Some Dialogue 

Engage an issue raised during the first five weeks of seminar by recording dialogue (or banter) with someone else in seminar. This should be an opportunity to integrate conversations and other perspectives into your proposed podcast.

Specs for your audio file: 10-15 minutes of you talking with someone else, plus a one- or two-sentence description of the recording and a list of works mentioned in it 

## Step 6 (Oct. 20th): Revise and Edit  

Now that some time has passed, revise the description for your proposed podcast and edit your first two recordings where / if necessary.  

## Step 7 (Oct. 27th): Record an Analysis of Voice or Dialogue 

Engage an issue raised during the first seven weeks of seminar by recording your analysis of a recorded voice or dialogue of your choice from what we've studied. This is your opportunity to treat audio as an object of inquiry in your proposed podcast.

Specs for your audio file: 5-10 minutes of you analyzing audio, plus a one- or two-sentence description of the recording and a list of works mentioned in it  

## Step 8 (Nov. 3rd): Let's Bib 

We'll start a collaboratively annotated bibliography that may inform your podcast episode. Please annotate two entries on the list and leave your name (in brackets) at the end of those entries. 

## Step 9 (Nov. 10th): Take a Break 

Step away from the seminar and your podcast for a bit. 

## Step 10 (Nov. 17th): Record an Analysis of a Sound Object or Soundscape 

Engage an issue raised during the first ten weeks of seminar by recording your analysis of a sound object (such as an effect) or a soundscape of your choice from what we've studied. This is your opportunity to engage audio beyond semantic listening. Y

Specs for your audio file: 5-10 minutes of you analyzing audio, plus a one- or two-sentence description of the recording and a list of works mentioned in it 

## Step 11 (Nov. 24th): Revise, Edit, Abstract, and Annotate 

Review your audio work thus far, revise and edit it where / if necessary, and draft a description (250 words) of the first episode of your podcast. Also annotate two more entries in our collaborative bib and leave your name after your annotations. 

## Step 12 (Dec. 1st): Record Part of Your First Episode 

Engage an issue raised during the seminar by recording part of your podcast's first episode. This is your opportunity to select critical approaches that work best for you and test them.  

Specs for your audio file: 3-8 minutes of you critically approaching audio and fiction how you wish, plus a 250-word description of your episode and a list of all works mentioned in it 

## Step 13 (Dec. 15th): Record Your First Episode 

Engage an issue raised during the seminar by recording your podcast's first episode. This is your opportunity to put 

Specs for your audio file: 12-20 minutes of you critically approaching audio and fiction how you wish, plus a 250-word description of your episode, a transcript for it, and a list of all works mentioned in it; be sure to introduce yourself and your podcast and to include verbal acknowledgments at the end; intro music, sound effects, and ambient sounds are optional
