# Description 

"Readers are listening." We'll treat that sentence, including its many implications, as a refrain for this seminar.

Readers are listening because, as a [2018 BookNet Canada report](https://www.booknetcanada.ca/readers-are-listening) suggests, more and more of them are purchasing audiobooks and subscribing to podcasts. Readers are listening because publishers, writers, actors, and critics are taking sound more seriously. Readers are listening because they've been diagnosed with print disabilities or visual impairments. They are listening because they are multitasking—listening while commuting, working at home, or engaging in hobbies. Readers are listening because they enjoy it, they need a break from screens, or they're playing games. The list goes on, all to demonstrate that the combination of reading and listening, or the characterization of listening as reading, is not a contradiction. Listening is not "cheating," or passive, or homogeneous, and it's long been central to the interpretation of fiction. This seminar explores how and why by treating listening as a critical practice.

You'll have the opportunity to test various approaches to listening by studying fiction (mostly Anglo-American) from the 20th and 21st centuries. To invite an array of expertise on the topic, I've selected a range of works that not only engage themes of sound and listening (as content) but also experiment with audio formats, such as radio plays, talking books, cut-ups, recorded readings, serialized drama, voice-over narration, and first-person videogames, where listeners cannot see the "source" of a sound. Each week, we'll examine a work or two with a particular theme or technique in mind. Themes will include listening to writers read, listening to narrators speak, listening for meaning, listening for effects, listening with others, listening in place, listening against the grain, listening spheres, and listening with machines. Across them, we'll consider the aesthetics and sensory politics of how readers listen to fiction and how fiction is composed to be heard. I'll also encourage you to try writing for readers who are listening by asking you to develop a portfolio of audio work comprised of brief exercises that culminate in an episode for a podcast of your design about a seminar topic of your choice.

# Aims 

This seminar contributes to your graduate education in English and/or Cultural, Social, and Political Thought by asking you to: 

* Watch, read, play, and—most important—listen critically to assigned materials. Here, my aim is to create an online space for you to not only practice multimodal and comparative approaches to media and fiction but also feed listening back into your own research areas, including (but not limited to) modern and contemporary literary criticism. 
* Approach audio and fiction from multiple angles, across numerous formats, to build experience in listening as an embodied, historical process where mediation is a question of both politics and aesthetics. Here, my aim is to create an online space for you to engage audio and fiction through cultural criticism, via questions such as, "Listening, but for whom, according to whom, how, under what assumptions, and to what effects?" 
* Design and gradually build an audio portfolio with feedback from your peers and me. Here, my aim is to create an online space for you to plan, draft, edit, and revise critical work on audio and fiction. This work may apply to both academic and non-academic communications.  
* Compose a single episode for a podcast of your design, supported by an annotated bibliography composed by everyone in the seminar, on a topic relevant to "Readers Are Listening." Here, my aim is to create an online space for you to practice making, supporting, expressing, and refining a long-form audio communication (12-20 minutes), with a transcript and description, about audio and fiction for a specific audience. This way, you compose both *about* and *with* audio. 
* Participate regularly (with your peers and me) in online seminar discussions about assigned topics and materials, including fiction made for audio as well as critical theories of listening, sound, audio, voices, deafness, and power. Here, my aim is to create an online space for you to practice sparking and sustaining critical conversations about media and fiction. 

I hope this approach to the online seminar offers you room to experiment with your own take on the theme of "Readers Are Listening," and to build upon your own interests and experiences. If you find that it does not, then please let me or the graduate adviser know, and I'll adjust my pedagogy accordingly.

# About Me 

My name is Jentery Sayers (he / him / his). I’m a settler scholar and associate professor of English and Cultural, Social, and Political Thought (CSPT), and I direct the Praxis Studio for Comparative Media Studies. I've been at UVic since 2011. I did my MA and PhD in English at the University of Washington, and I grew up in Richmond, Virginia, where I also got my BA and BS (at Virginia Commonwealth University). Most of my work is in comparative media studies, including sound studies. I teach American fiction, media and cultural studies, prototyping, and materialism at UVic. This is the tenth graduate seminar I've taught at the university, but my first online. I'll be learning quite a bit as we go. Thanks for your patience, and apologies in advance for any hiccups on my end. 

# Structure and Assignments

I've structured this online seminar around **three assignments, all of which can be performed asynchronously**: an audio portfolio (marked twice, as Portfolio 1 and 2, each 25% of your mark), participation in online discussion forums (marked twice, as Discussion 1 and 2, each 10% of your mark), and a final project: an episode for a podcast of your design (30% of your mark). The portfolio and forums will help you to gradually develop your final project, and I've integrated them into the seminar as tasks or activities to be performed each week. To clarify expectations and also render transparent my approach to assessment, I will provide rubrics for all three assignments.

If you are interested and able to participate in a synchronous seminar, then we'll meet on Zoom every Tuesday, from 1:30 until 2:50pm Pacific. Please note that **Zoom meetings are optional**. I'll email you the URL for our Zoom, and it'll remain the same for the entire term. The meetings will usually begin with brief, prerecorded remarks from me on the assigned materials and issues we've been discussing in Brightspace. I'll post these remarks to Brightspace each week in case you're unable to attend the Zoom meetings or you'd like to refer to my remarks later. The remarks will be available in audio and text formats. 

The balance of the course, including the discussion forums, audio portfolio, and final project, will happen in the seminar Brightspace, which you should be able to access via your UVic account. If you cannot access the seminar Brightspace, then please let me know. You'll use Brightspace to submit your assignments, and we will all use it to engage in conversations and provide feedback on work in progress. I'll also use it to return marks, post announcements, and point to you resources here and there.  

# Workload

The most important thing to know about this seminar is that **I'll opt for care in every instance.** If the workload becomes too much, or we're juggling more than we should, then we'll cut materials, including assignments, as we go. I've planned for the maximum in advance, under the assumption that we won't get to everything. And that's totally fine.  

I suggest dedicating 5 to 6 hours of study each week to this seminar, plus 1.5 hours for the weekly Zoom meetings if you're able to attend them. To frame expectations and decrease overwork, I assign in the schedule (below) a number of recommended hours to each aspect of the seminar, and I communicate progress in terms of weekly steps (0-13) toward your final project, partially because online learning makes time weird for us all, and focusing on one thing can be a struggle right now, to say the least. 

Of course, 5 to 6 hours per week is only a guideline. You may find that you need more or less time depending on the activity, your preferences, and your own familiarity with the work and materials involved. 

Please also note that we'll start the seminar (the first third) with introductory materials and a bulk of our reading and listening. Most of the last third (November and early December) will be dedicated to preparing your final projects (again, an episode in a podcast of your design). The middle third is like a bridge, where you'll have a chance to experiment and refine your ideas. We'll adjust along the way to ensure none of this is too much for you (or me). 

# Materials 

The only thing you should purchase (or rent) for this seminar is Toni Morrison's *The Bluest Eye* as an audiobook, where she is the reader and voice actress. You may want to grab a print copy, too. The remaining materials are available openly online, via UVic Libraries, or in Brightspace. I hope this approach keeps costs down for you. 

Here's a list of the primary materials I've assigned. They are intended to help us cover a range of audio and fiction, across formats, while grounding our research in questions of critical listening and its relation to reading. 

* Audiobook: Toni Morrison’s *The Bluest Eye* (1970)
* Recorded reading: Edwidge Danticat reading (2013) Jamaica Kincaid’s "Girl" (1978) and "Wingless" (1979)
* Radio play: Samuel Beckett's *All That Fall: A Play for Radio* (1957)
* Sound art: Delia Derbyshire's "Ziwzih Ziwzih OO-OO-OO" (1967), Alvin Lucier's *I Am Sitting in a Room* (1969-70),  King Tubby and The Aggrovators, "Dub Fi Gwan" (1977), and Laurie Anderson's *O Superman* (1981) 
* Serialized audio drama: *Within the Wires* (Season One, “Relaxation Cassettes”) (2016), by Jeffrey Cranor, Janina Matthewson, and Mary Epworth
* Voice-over narration: performances by Regina King (2005), Edward Norton (1999), Christina Ricci (1998), and Sissy Spacek (1973)
* First-person games: Giant Sparrow's *What Remains of Edith Finch* (2017) and Lucas Pope's *Return of the Obra Dinn* (2018)

For your reference, I've also compiled a series of brief, critical introductions to listening and related issues. These introductions are written mostly from a sound studies angle, and you will find them in Brightspace or via UVic Libraries.  

* "Listening," by Roland Barthes (15 pages) 
* "Contradicting Media: Toward a Political Phenomenology of Listening," by Jody Berland (4 pages)
* "Into Sound," by Michael Bull and Les Back (16 pages)
* "The Three Listening Modes," by Michel Chion (9 pages)
* "Operating System for the Redesign of Sonic Reality," by Kodwo Eshun (15 pages)
* "Listening through History," by Douglas Kahn (19 pages)
* "Sound," by Michele Hilmes (2 pages)
* "Profound Listening and Environmental Sound Matter," by Francisco López (6 pages)
* "Deafness," by Mara Mills (8 pages)
* "Some Sound Observations," by Pauline Oliveros (5 pages)
* "Listening," by Tom Rice (8 pages)
* "Hungry Listening," by Dylan Robinson (36 pages)
* "Approaching Sound," by Tara Rodgers (8 pages)
* "Sonic Imaginations," by Jonathan Sterne (12 pages)
* "Hearing," by Jonathan Sterne (8 pages)

We will also use two discussion forums (as part of your marks for Discussion 1 and 2) to collaboratively build an annotated bibliography, which I'm populating for you with publications by several of the above scholars as well as Lawrence Abu Hamdan, Daphne Brooks, John Cage, Jason Camlot, Anne Margaret Castro, Adriana Cavarero, David Cecchetto, Steph Ceraso, Tanya Clement, Angela Davis, Susan Douglas, Nina Sun Eidsheim, Ralph Ellison, Brian Eno, Frantz Fanon, Julie Funk, Sumanth Gopinath, Lisa Gitelman, Iben Have, Brian Kane, Anahid Kassabian, Sarah Kozloff, James Lastra, Hannah McGregor, Paul D. Miller (DJ Shadow), Cat Moses, Fred Moten, John Durham Peters, Richard Cullen Rath, Tara Rodgers, Tricia Rose, Matthew Rubery, Murray Schafer, Pierre Schaeffer, Karis Shearer, Kaja Silverman, Robin Small‐McCarthy, Jennifer Lynn Stoever, Birgitte Stougaard Pedersen, Juan A. Suárez, Emily Thompson, David Toop, Olga Touloumi, Alexander Weheliye, Anna Williams, Virginia Woolf, Iannis Xenakis, and Pamela Z. I will ask each of you to annotate only four entries in the bib. 

Finally, I recommend the website, *Sounding Out!*, edited by Jennifer Lynn Stoever, as well as podcasts such as *SpokenWeb* and *Phantom Power*. They are excellent resources for keeping up with audio and fiction as well as sound studies. 

As for audio technologies that may be useful in this seminar, I recommend Audacity and some headphones or earbuds. You may want an external microphone as well, but that's certainly optional. For more on gear, see [this post](https://superbon.net/2020/08/13/recording-your-lectures-3-gear-gear-gear/) by Jonathan Sterne or email me. I'm happy to talk more about the tech I use for audio work.
